The supreme and confirmation representatives will serve one year terms each. Every year, entirely new supreme and confirmation representative groups will take over control, yet to make sure the new representatives are completely informed, there will be a transition month in which the new and old groups share ideas and educate each other on the current situations. The short terms allow for power to change and never corrupt the system by letting one person take too much control of it. Each candidate will be given an equal sum of money for campaigning. Anyone can run except in order to get campaign money to become an official candidate, one must enter themselves in a "pre-ballot" and of that ballot, only the twenty most voted for will be given the money to run for election to one of the ten representative positions.  Because only one yearlong term will be allowed, no time while in control will go to finding campaign supporters and funding.  Voting for sector mayors, supreme representatives and confirmation representatives will all be done via a website annually for the two latter groups and every two years for the mayors.  Voting will be mandatory and in order to provide as much fraud protection as possible, in order to vote, citizens will enter their I.D. number also used for transport.  Only ballots cast using official I.D.s will be cast and processed.  Instead of having what can sometimes be an extremely complicated system as is the case in the U.S. government (pictured at right), the government of Pensarora aims to be more dynamic and controlled more by the will of its people.</p>
