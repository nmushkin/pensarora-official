All of the code within this repository was compiled and written almost entirely by me, Noah Mushkin, save for the .css and .js files.

This open-source repository contains nearly all of the code for the Official Website Of Pensarora (www.pensarora.org)
Hopefully, this code can be used and forked by any one seeking to build a website for a city or community.  Over time,
if people see this repository and start to use it, hopefully the website code will become more advanced and improve overall.

Instructions:
The Official Website Of Pensarora was done on an Amazon EC2 Instance with apapche installed, if you want to get apache and
MYSQL installed, follow this tutorial: http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/01/setting-up-wordpress-on-amazon-ec2-in-5-minutes/  
up until the author talks about creating a MYSQL database.
For the entire website to function properly, you will need a MYSQL database named cards with a table inside called cardinfo.
Within the table cardinfo, you will need to create a row for id (primary key and auto incrementing), name, and message.
This database will be used for the recording history via social media page of your site.  You should also install php, the 
above tutorial will show you how.

Once you ssh into your ec2 instance, (look up how to online), you can go to the var/www/ folder and replace the html folder
there with the one in this repository.  After some tweaking, it should be all set up.

Notes:  A micro EC2 amazon instance is all that is needed.  For information on getting the right instance, check the above
mentioned tutorial.
