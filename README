This open-source repository contains nearly all of the code for the Official Website Of Pensarora (pensarora.org)
Hopefully, this code can be used and forked by any one seeking to build a website for a city or community.  Over time,
if people see this repository and start to use it, hopefully the website code will become more advanced and improve overall.
